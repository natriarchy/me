      <p>I was raised mostly in a suburb at the Northern end of New Jersey, 20 minutes from New York. Set amidst the patchwork of unending suburbia that is Bergen County, Ridgewood was the second town I had lived in with “wood” in its name. The quaint community dates to the late 1800s, when it was an early railroad town. Its region of Bergen County would end up being ground zero for the rise of strip-, outlet-, luxury-, and mega-mall developments—see the many malls of Paramus, and Routes 17 or 4. Highways were built to crisscross the never-ending expanse of large-lot suburban homes, connecting them to the new commercial strips and to New York City.</P>
      <p>Ridgewood’s downtown is largely the same as it was in the 1950s; only with a few more roads, parking lots, car-dealerships and a network of other car-based infrastructure. Most of the regions’ traditional commercial corridors were hollowed out, but Ridgewood nurtured its reputation as a dining mecca in the area.</P>
      <p>It was a nice place to grow up and learn, but it seemed a rather insular community. The community was homogenous and didn’t inspire a curious kid to wander and explore. The public spaces felt sanitized of the elements that allow tweens and teens to gain a sense of independence. In my teenage mind, everything interesting was only reachable by car; namely, the best fast food joints, wilderness reserves, or my friends’ houses. Until I was 17, driving was mainly the province of parents or older siblings.</p>
      <p>I spent most of my college years at George Washington University in Washington, DC, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science in 2015. Living in DC was a treat. I was absolutely taken with the monumental architecture, beautiful townhomes, and the life of the city. While I was there, I was steeped in national politics but also developed a discrete passion for urban policy. The freedom of exploring the city and using the DC Metro astounded me. This was also amidst the peak of the city’s renaissance. With all the new buildings going up, I followed all the local news blogs and got caught up in all the policy debates.</p>
      <p>I took an architecture class my senior year on a whim, and it was my first exposure to urban planning as a field of design and policy. After graduation, I worked at an intellectual property law firm, and fully expected to go to law school someday. However, the eight months I worked there only solidified my desire to pursue urban planning. I read up on the greats of urban planning theory (incl. Jane Jacobs, Jan Gehl, Jarret Walker, etc.), and was eventually accepted to Rutgers University’s Bloustein School of Planning & Public Policy to obtain a master’s degree in community and regional planning.</p>
      <p>I was lucky enough to get some travelling in just before classes began. I backpacked across Europe for more than a month, a perfect opportunity to marvel at the design of 13 great cities. It was a great intro to good and bad urban design. I graduated from Bloustein in December of 2018. In the time since, I have continued learning new computer skills, worked on myself, and developed more of my hobbies. I am an avid guitarist, and a general lover of all things music. In my life, I have read biographies on a third of the US presidents, amongst several other historical tomes. These days, I spend a lot of time thinking on and researching the trends that will come to shape our lives and environments as the next few decades unfold.</P>
